## 📖 Overview

**WorkSphere** is a production-style full-stack workspace built around a realistic company workflow.

Managers can create projects, manage employees, assign tasks, and review daily work updates. Employees can view their assignments, complete tasks, submit daily updates, report blockers, and manage their profiles.

The application uses a separate **Next.js frontend** and **Laravel REST API**, with **Sanctum authentication, role-based authorization, relational database design, file management, and cloud deployment**.

## 🔗 Live Demo

* **App:** [work-sphere-pi-taupe.vercel.app](https://work-sphere-pi-taupe.vercel.app/)

> 🔐 Demo accounts are available for testing both Manager and Employee workflows.

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

WorkSphere demonstrates practical full-stack development across:

**System Architecture → Database Design → REST APIs → Authentication → Authorization → CRUD → Role-Based Workflows → File Handling → Frontend Integration → Responsive UI → Docker → Cloud Deployment**

The project was built to simulate a **real internal business application**, rather than a simple CRUD demonstration.
